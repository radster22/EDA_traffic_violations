# EDA MOntgomery County Traffic Violations
To begin with, we cleaned our data using various Python libraries, focusing on key columns such as "Date of Stop," which includes day, month, year, and time. We also filtered out redundant columns, such as geolocation.

Findings on Violations and Accidents

We observed an overall decline in traffic violations from 2018 to 2020, likely due to COVID-19, with this trend continuing into 2024, possibly because of effective enforcement strategies. However, there was not a significant decrease in the number of accidents, which may be attributed to changes in behavior in the presence of enforcement or increased use of warnings rather than citations.

Peak violations occurred during office rush hours on weekdays, while weekends saw more violations at night. This suggests an opportunity for increased enforcement during those times. Notably, Tuesday emerged as the busiest day, potentially due to "Monday blues."

Trends in Arrests and Violations

While the number of arrests remained relatively stable, we did observe a positive trend: the number of ESERO (vehicle repair order) violations significantly decreased, indicating improved driver safety. Additionally, there was a notable amount of property damage compared to personal injury.

Traffic Stop Analysis and Community Disparities

Our analysis revealed significant disparities in traffic stops among different communities. In Montgomery County, with a total population of around 1 million, we identified the following key stop rate disparities:

Black drivers: +12% (30% of stops vs. 18% of population)
Asian drivers: -10% (6% of stops vs. 16% of population)
White drivers: -8% (35% of stops vs. 43% of population)
Latinx drivers: +2% (21% of stops vs. 19% of population)
Further investigation could explore how population density affects traffic patterns and how different employment centers influence travel routes leading to traffic violations. Additionally, service industry workers are more likely to travel during late hours.

Conclusion

Our EDA provides valuable insights into community behavior and population dynamics, highlighting how optimal resource utilization can enhance enforcement strategies. The emphasis on transparency and trust-building aligns with the goals of the Montgomery County Police Department (MCPD), suggesting that data-driven insights can strengthen community relationships and improve public perceptions of policing efforts.

In conclusion, regarding our hypothesis—Do certain demographic groups experience higher traffic stop rates?—the answer varies based on time, population density, and different employment sectors, which all influence the routes taken and the accumulation of traffic violations.
